# 👋 Hello, GitHub

I'm **_Zihan_ (陈子涵)** — you can call me **/ziːˈhɑːn/** 🎧.

🎓 I'm a **Ph.D. student in Computer Science** at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), where my research explores exciting areas in **computer systems** — from **computer architecture** 🏗️ and **compiler design** 🧱 to **high-performance computing (HPC)** ⚡.

🧪 Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of  **Quantum Computing** — especially quantum computer **architecture** and **applications**.  
I aim to leverage techniques from classical architecture 🏛️, compiler design 🧠, and machine learning 🤖 to enhance the **programmability**, **fault tolerance**, and **scalability** of next-gen quantum systems 🧬✨.

💼 I previously interned at AI Health, where I developed cloud-based radiology AI solutions and integrated Large Language Models (LLM) into healthcare applications. These products are now deployed in leading hospitals and research institutions globally, with some commercially available and others still in the experimental phase.
