# Hello GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I'm *Zihan* an senior students from NUIST, you can call me Cesar. If you have any questions about my work, please feel free to contact me.

## EducationðŸ“š

- Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology(NUIST), Nanjing, China

  Major in Telecommunication Engineering (Joint Program with University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)
  
- <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B6%82%E9%95%BF%E6%9C%9B" target="_blank">Changwang</a> School of Honors,  NUIST, Nanjing, China

## Research Experience & InterestsðŸŒž

- **Industrial Sound Measurements** based on deep learning
- **Atherosclerosis Detection** and classification based on machine learning

  \[One **first-author** paper was accepted and two patent applications were submitted]
- **Wearable Tech Device**

  Because of China's well-developed logistics industry, I often heard of workers with a huge workload. Workers face the dilemma that they cannot sort cargo and scan QR code simultaneously with their two hands, which reduces their work efficiency and accuracy. I hope to design a wearable device to solve this with my knowledge of microcontroller and recognition algorithm.

  \[One **first-inventor** patent was issued]
