# Hello GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I'm _Zihan_ a first year graduate student in Rutgers University-New Brunswick Computer Science, you can call me _Cesar_. 

I graduate from Changwang School of Honors in Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology(NUIST), I earned Bachelor of Engineering in a joint program with University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, major in Telecommunication Engineering.

I'm looking for 2023 Summer Internship of Computer Science and Data Science. If you have any questions about my work or potential cooperation, please feel free to contact me(cesarchen616@outlook.com).

## EducationðŸ“š

- Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, United States

  Major in Computer Science

- Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology(NUIST), Nanjing, China

  Major in Telecommunication Engineering (Joint Program with University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)
  
- <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B6%82%E9%95%BF%E6%9C%9B" target="_blank">Changwang</a> School of Honors,  NUIST, Nanjing, China

## Research Experience & InterestsðŸŒž

- **Industrial Sound Measurements** based on Time-Frequency analysis and artificial neural network

- **Atherosclerosis Detection** and classification based on data science and machine learning

  \[One **first-author** paper published and two patent applications were submitted]
  
- **Wearable Tech Device**

  Because of China's well-developed logistics industry, I often heard of workers with a huge workload. Workers face the dilemma that they cannot sort cargo and scan QR code simultaneously with their two hands, which reduces their work efficiency and accuracy. I hope to design a wearable device to solve this with my knowledge of microcontroller and recognition algorithm.

  \[One **first-inventor** patent issued]
